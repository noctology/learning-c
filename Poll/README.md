Poll a socket. The original poll.c polls stdin which is a file descriptor. This works in Unix/Linux because file descriptors and socket descriptors are essentially the same and even share some functions (e.g., close). This is not true in Windows. The following links provide examples of polling a socket in both Unix/Linux and Windows, respectively. Note that the function in Windows is "WSAPoll", not "poll".
